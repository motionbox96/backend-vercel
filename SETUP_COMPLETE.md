# DesignForge360 Backend Development Guide

## ✅ Backend Status: WORKABLE

Your backend is now properly set up and working! Here's what has been verified:

### ✅ What's Working:
- ✅ All dependencies are installed (`npm install` completed successfully)
- ✅ Environment variables are configured (`.env` file present)
- ✅ Razorpay integration is set up with live keys
- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ Express.js server is properly configured
- ✅ CORS is configured for multiple frontend origins
- ✅ All payment endpoints are implemented

### 🎯 Available API Endpoints:
1. **Health Check**: `GET /api/health`
2. **Create Order**: `POST /api/create-order`
3. **Verify Payment**: `POST /api/verify-payment`
4. **Get Payment**: `GET /api/payment/:paymentId`
5. **Capture Payment**: `POST /api/capture-payment`
6. **Refund Payment**: `POST /api/refund-payment`
7. **Webhook Handler**: `POST /api/webhook`

### 🚀 How to Start Your Backend:

```bash
# Development mode (with nodemon for auto-restart)
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start

# Or directly with node
node server.js
```

### 🔧 Environment Configuration:
Your `.env` file is configured with:
- ✅ Razorpay LIVE keys (real payments active)
- ✅ Development environment settings
- ✅ Port 3001 configured

### ⚠️ Important Notes:
1. **LIVE KEYS ACTIVE**: Your Razorpay keys are live production keys - all transactions will process real money
2. **For Development**: Consider switching to test keys during development
3. **CORS**: Frontend origins are pre-configured for localhost and production domains

### 🧪 Test Your Backend:
1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Test health endpoint: `http://localhost:3001/api/health`
3. Your backend will be running on `http://localhost:3001`

### 📱 Frontend Integration:
Your backend is ready to receive requests from:
- Local development (localhost:5173-5182)
- Production domains (designforge360.in, netlify, vercel)

The backend is fully workable and ready for production use!
